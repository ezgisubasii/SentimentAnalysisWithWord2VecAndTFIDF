Both IPython notebooks we installed perform sentiment analysis. Their duties are exactly the same. The only difference between the two notebooks is the vectorization technique used. ML_TF-IDF notebook uses tfidf vectorization, ML_Word2Vec notebook uses word2vec embedding. We compare model performance for different vectorzation techniques. To run the codes, you can upload them directly to the colab environment or run them in your Python IDE. If you do not have the libraries used, you can install the libraries with the "!pip install library_name"Â command.
